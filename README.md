## Low-resource ASR research
**Speech representation**: contrastive learning, generative learning and other methods  
1. **[VQ-CPC code](https://github.com/ReinholdM/VectorQuantizedCPC)**: Vector Quantization loss (reconstruction of  Conv1d encoded input and rnn output) and CPC loss (cross-entropy loss of predictor from rnn output and negative samples with label 0, aiming to adjacement output and encoder output) discrete representation with CPC :ocean:  

**Augmentation**:  

**Transfer learning**:  

## Multilingual ASR
Embedding multilingual information in discrete representaion like codebook.
Paper: **[UNSUPERVISED PRETRAINING TRANSFERS WELL ACROSS LANGUAGES](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02848.pdf)**:CPC for speech representation across languages pre-training
