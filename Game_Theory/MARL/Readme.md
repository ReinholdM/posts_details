## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning  
**A Simple Introduction of MARL**. More details can be described in the review.pdf    

The taxonomy of MARL can be  


1. **Fully Cooperative**: The core goal is to optimize the total return
2. **Fully Competitive** : General situation sets the sum of returns as zero
3. **A mix of the two**: Contains both of two



Three features in MARL comparing to RL with single agent:  

1. **Multi-dimensional**: 多维度无对齐，且难以定义评估收益的方法
2. **Non-stationary**: 每个agent只看重自己的收益
3. **Joint action space** exponentially increase with the number of agents
